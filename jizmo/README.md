# jizmo

This is an attempt to implement a service we currently develop in ruby, to implement in clojure.
The reason is, that clojure sucks way less than ruby and makes the programmer happy :)
Also it shall show if lisp really is superior.

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
