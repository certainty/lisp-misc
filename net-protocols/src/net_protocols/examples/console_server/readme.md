These examples illustrate the usage of the library on
console servers. server.clj implements a mock server that only supports
a few commands.

== Usage

=== Server

lein example-server

=== Client

lein example-client

=== Note

Currently you must restart the server (Ctrl-c and (start-server 12345))
after each client run
